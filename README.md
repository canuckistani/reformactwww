reformactwww
============

A website to promote The Reform Act (an upcoming Private Member's Bill to reform the Parliament of Canada)

Who started this?
=================

Someone who doesn't want The Reform Act to get scuttled by any party leaders who won't want
a check placed on their unchecked powers.

What do you say to party leaders wanting unchecked power?
=========================================================

I say bullshit.

What can I do?
==============

Since you're reading the README on GitHub, fork the code and send a pull-request with your improvements. See below
for feature requests and design stuff. Drop an idea in Issues.

Then also share it, tell people about the bill, and make sure all the party leaders, all the MPs,
all the backroom fundraisers, and all the partisans get the message that THIS BILL MUST PASS.

I can hack. What needs hacking?
===============================

Ideas welcome. 

I'm thinking *www.ReformAct.ca* should be a sexy, single-page social media and "email the powers
that be" jugernaught? A standard "education + action" page? One part inform people why the bill
is good and why it could not get passed, another part email/phone/tweet/sms/hand-write-a-letter
the MPs call to action?

With that in mind, the following help would be great as a starter.

* single page scrolling page, CSS sexy as possible. (This scrolling resume)[http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/] is an interesting idea
* bootstrap3 under the hood, or not (but it's already there).
* social media share buttons and such

Features
========

* twitter share button, "@" the party leaders
* facebook share button 
* facebook photos for sharing
* email buttons (using PHPMailer)

NON-Features
============

* No database. I don't want to save any information. This website is not for harvesting
  contact info. It's just about getting the bill passed.

Development and Hosting
=======================

A "git checkout" of the site is already hosted on Amazon EC2. I'll accept pull-requests (once I learn how - who 
wants to 1-up me by sending the first one?) then push from github/master as often as needed.

reformactwww
============

A website to promote The Reform Act - an upcoming Private Member's Bill to reform the Parliament of Canada

Who started this?
=================

Someone who doesn't want The Reform Act to get scuttled by the various party leaders - who won't want
a check placed on their power over caucus and MPs.

What do you say to that?
========================

I say bullshit.

Are you a "partisan"
====================

Yes, but I don't let it get in the way of good ideas. The Reform Act is a good idea. Let's make it happen.

Is this some elaborate hoax?
============================

No. I hatched this idea late on a Friday night after reading Coyne's piece on the bill.
http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/11/29/andrew-coyne-reform-act-bill-would-change-canadas-parliament-forever/

I decided if the bill has any hope of passing it's because a few tens of thousands of Canadians
stood up and demanded. That needs a website. There wasn't one yet. So I'm just getting the ball rolling.

What can I do?
==============

Since you're reading the README on GitHub, fork the code and send a pull-request with your improvements.

Then also share it, tell people about the bill, and make sure all the party leaders, all the MPs,
all the backroom fundraisers, and all the partisans get the message that THIS BILL MUST PASS.

I can hack. What needs hacking?
===============================

I'm thinking *the.reformact.ca* should be a sexy, single-page social media and "email the powers
that be" jugernaught? A standard "education + action" page. One part inform people why the bill
is good and why it could not get passed, another part email/phone/tweet/sms/hand-write-a-letter
the MPs call to action?

Ideas welcome. 

I'm typing this all out quickly before posting to Reddit. How big this gets and
how much momentum we can put behind the bill really depends on who else jumps on the bandwagon.

With that in mind, the following help would be great:

* single page scrolling page, CSS sexy as possible. (This scrolling resume)[http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/] is an interesting idea
* bootstrap3 under the hood, or not (but it's already there).
* social media share buttons and such

Features
========

* twitter share button, "@" the party leaders
* facebook share button 
* facebook photos for sharing
* email buttons (using PHPMailer)

NON-Features
============

* No database. I don't want to save any information. This website is not for harvesting
  contact info. It's just about getting the bill passed.

Development and Hosting
=======================

A "git checkout" of the site is already hosted on Amazon EC2. I'll accept pull-requests (once I learn how - who 
wants to 1-up me by sending the first one?) then push from github/master as often as needed.

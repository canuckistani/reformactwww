reformactwww
============

A website to promote The Reform Act - an upcoming Private Member's Bill to reform the Parliament of Canada

Who started this?
=================

Someone who doesn't want The Reform Act to get scuttled by the various party leaders - who won't want
a check placed on their power over caucus and MPs.

What do you say to that?
========================

I say bullshit.

Are you a "partisan"
====================

Yes, but meaningful restoration of our Westminster Parliamentary system is really important.

What can I do?
==============

Since you're reading the README on GitHub, fork the code and send a pull-request with your improvements.

Then also share it, tell people about the bill, and make sure all the party leaders, all the MPs,
all the backroom fundraisers, and all the partisans get the message that THIS BILL MUST PASS.

I can hack. What needs hacking?
===============================

I'm thinking *the.reformact.ca* should be a sexy, single-page social media and "email the powers
that be" jugernaught? With that in mind, the following help would be great:

* single page scrolling page, CSS sexy as possible. (This scrolling resume)[http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/] is an interesting idea
* bootstrap3 under the hood
* social media share buttons and such

Features
========

* twitter share button, "@" the party leaders
* facebook share button 
* facebook photos for sharing
* email buttons (using PHPMailer)

NON-Features
============

* No database. I don't want to save any information. This website is not for harvesting
  contact info. It's just about getting the bill passed.

Hosting
=======

I'll take care of hosting via an existing AWS EC2 server.
